                  for functional logic languages covering notions like
                  laziness, sharing, concurrency, non-determinism,
                  etc. Such a semantics is not only important to
                  provide appropriate language definitions to reason
                  about programs and check the correctness of
                  implementations but it is also a basis to develop
                  language-specific tools, like program tracers,
                  profilers, optimizers, etc. First, we define a
                  "big-step" semantics in natural style to relate
                  expressions and their evaluated results. Since this
                  semantics is not sufficient to cover concurrency,
                  search strategies, or to reason about costs
                  associated to particular computations, we also
                  define a "small-step" operational semantics covering
                  the features of modern functional logic languages. }

                  declarative programming languages. In constraint
                  programs, the solutions of a problem are obtained by
                  specifying their desired properties, whereas in
                  imperative programs, the steps which lead to a

                  programmer write programs by specifying what the
                  properties of the desired solutions should be. In
                  imperative languages, the calculation steps leading
                  to the solutions must be programmed explicitly. The
                  programming language Turtle combines traditional
                  imperative language constructs and declarative
                  constraints. This blending of paradigms is called
                  ``constraint imperative programming'' in literature,
                  and Turtle is one instance of this multiparadigm
                  approach.}

                  of functional and logic programming languages. A
                  sound and complete operational semantics for logic
                  programs with equality is based on resolution to
                  solve literals, and rewriting and narrowing to
                  evaluate functional expressions. This paper proposes
                  a technique for compiling programs with these
                  inference rules into programs of a low-level
                  abstract machine which can be efficiently executed
                  on conventional architectures. The presented
                  approach is based on an extension of the Warren
                  abstract machine (WAM). In our approach pure logic
                  programs without function definitions are compiled
                  in the same way as in the WAM-approach, and for
                  logic programs with function definitions particular
                  instructions are generated for occurrences of
                  functions inside clause bodies. In order to obtain
                  an efficient implementation of functional
                  computations, a stack of occurrences of function
                  symbols in goals is managed by the abstract
                  machine. The compiler generates the necessary
                  instructions for the efficient manipulation of the
                  occurrence stack from the given equational logic
                  program. }

                  search for solutions), and integrated functional
                  logic languages (residuation and narrowing). This
                  computation model combines efficient evaluation
                  principles of functional languages with the
                  problem-solving capabilities of logic
                  programming. Since the model allows the delay of
                  function calls which are not sufficiently
                  instantiated, it also supports a concurrent style of
                  programming. We provide soundness and completeness
                  results and show that known evaluation principles of
                  functional logic languages are particular instances
                  of this model. Thus, our model is a suitable basis

  abstract =	 {Escher is a declarative, general-purpose programming
                  language which integrates the best features of both
                  functional and logic programming languages. It has
                  types and modules, higher-order and meta-programming
                  facilities, and declarative input/output. Escher
                  also has a collection of system modules, providing
                  numerous operations on standard data types such as
                  integers, lists, characters, strings, sets, and
                  programs. The main design aim is to combine in a
                  practical and comprehensive way the best ideas of
                  existing functional and logic languages, such as
                  G\"odel, Haskell, and $\lambda$Prolog. Indeed,
                  Escher goes well beyond G\"odel in its ability to
                  allow function definitions, its higher-order
                  facilities, its improved handling of sets, and its
                  declarative input/output. Escher also goes well
                  beyond Haskell in its ability to run
                  partly-instantiated predicate calls, a familiar
                  feature of logic programming languages which
                  provides a form of non-determinism, and its more
                  flexible handling of equality. The language also has
                  a clean semantics, its underlying logic being (an
                  extension of) Church's simple theory of types. This
                  report is divided into two parts. The first part
                  provides a tutorial introduction to Escher. In this
                  part there are many example programs to illustrate
                  the various language features. In particular, these
                  example programs are meant to emphasize the
                  significant practical advantages that come from
                  integrating the best features of existing functional
                  and logic languages. The second part contains a
                  formal definition of the Escher language, including
                  its syntax, semantics, and a description of its
                  system modules. To make the report self-contained,
                  an appendix summarizes the key aspects of the simple
                  theory of types. },

                  high-level language for writing constraint solvers,
                  a generic search engine and a tool to visualize the

  abstract =	 {Many useful programming language extensions and
                  support libraries require knowledge of the locations
                  of fields within objects at run time. Examples
                  include orthogonal persistent object stores, precise
                  garbage collectors, data structure picklers and
                  parameter marshaling schemes. For clean and
                  efficient implementation as libraries, these systems
                  require run-time knowledge of in-memory layouts of
                  data objects, which is unavailable in most
                  traditionally-compiled and linked programming
                  languages, such as C, C++, and Ada. Even C++'s
                  recently-standardized run-time type identification
                  (RTTI) feature is insufficient, because it describes
                  language-level features of the type hierarchy and
                  not compiler-dependent object layout decisions. We
                  present a facility for run-time type description or
                  RTTD, which extracts low-level layout information
                  from debugging information generated by conventional
                  compilers, and makes it available to user
                  programs. We believe this to be the simplest and
                  most portable approach to run-time type description,
                  requiring no changes to existing compilers. In this
                  paper, we describe the basic strategies and present
                  details of our implementation for C++. We also
                  sketch some extensions that we have implemented,
                  including special treatment of C++'s virtual
                  function table pointers to match persistent or
                  foreign data objects with the actual code in a
                  particular application. Our implementation of
                  run-time type description is freely available. It is
                  in regular use with multiple operating systems and
                  compilers, in both free and commercial products,
                  including a high-performance persistent object
                  storage system for C++ and a real-time garbage
                  collector. }

  abstract =	 "This paper presents the architecture of a virtual
                  machine designed specifically for the execution of
                  multiple languages, which we call SEAM. The
                  architecture consists of a number of generic
                  components, usable by all languages, and of a number
                  of interfaces for which implementations have to be
                  provided by language implementors. Our contribution
                  is the identification of the generic services and
                  the clean design for the parameterization over their
                  language-specific aspects. The goal of SEAM is to
                  provide both for ample reuse and simple language
                  implementation, concerning both compilers and
                  runtime components, and to be a platform for
                  language interoperation. We have implemented a
                  prototype version of SEAM and validated it with two
                  language implementations. We present a full running

  title =	 "Integration of Verification and Testing into
                  Compilation Systems -- Concept and Case Study",
  abstract =	 "In this thesis we present a compiler architecture
                  that enables the compiler to check the correctness
                  of the source code \emph{as part of the compilation
                  process}. It allows to perform these correctness
                  checks with \emph{different} methods, in particular
                  formal testing and formal proof. \par A fully
                  automated check is very expensive and often
                  impossible. Hence, it is not feasible to check
                  correctness automatically with the help of
                  specification and implementation. We extend the
                  programming language by (correctness)
                  \emph{justifications} that the user must insert into
                  the source code (``\emph{literate
                  justification}''). Depending on the chosen
                  justification method the user must work out the
                  justification in more or less detail. The
                  introduction of justifications changes the
                  compiler's task from deriving a correctness proof by
                  itself to \emph{checking a correctness proof}
                  provided by the user. \par The correctness check for
                  justifications can be integrated into the compiler
                  or delegated to an external tool. An external tool
                  allows the integration of existing tools but the
                  development of specialized tools is also
                  possible. The example development of a specialized
                  tactical theorem-prover shows that the development
                  of a specialized tool is not necessarily more
                  expensive than the adaptation of an existing
                  tool. \par For test execution during the compilation
                  an \emph{interpreter} must be available. The
                  execution of untested code causes \emph{security
                  risks}. We discuss different possibilities to deal
                  with this problem. \par The \emph{correctness} of a
                  compilation unit corresponds to the
                  \emph{consistency of an algebraic specification}. We
                  study two proof methods: either by construction of a
                  model or by establishing a correctness-preserving
                  relation. The proof obligations result from the
                  proof method, in addition proof obligations are
                  introduced to ensure the correctness of modular
                  programs. \par The compiler architecture described
                  in this thesis has been \emph{prototypically
                  implemented}. The \textsc{opal} system has been
                  extended with language elements to denote
                  specifications and (correctness) justifications. The
                  thesis presents some short examples. The
                  \textsc{opal/j} prototype is part of the
                  \textsc{opal} distribution since version
                  \texttt{2.3e}.",

                  compilation scheme for mutually-recursive
                  definitions in call-by-value functional
                  languages. This scheme supports a wider range of
                  recursive definitions than standard call-by-value
                  recursive de nitions. We formalize our technique as
                  a translation scheme to a lambda-calculus featuring
                  in-place update of memory blocks, and prove the
                  translation to be faithful.}

  title =	 {OPL++: A Modeling Layer for Constraint Programming
                  Libraries},
  abstract =	 {Mathematical modeling and constraint programming
                  languages have orthogonal strengths in stating
                  combinatorial optimization problems. Modeling
                  languages typically feature high-level set and
                  algebraic notations, while constraint programming
                  languages provide a rich constraint language and the
                  ability to specify search procedures. This paper
                  shows that many of the functionalities typically
                  found in modeling languages can be integrated
                  elegantly in constraint programming libraries
                  without defining a specific language or
                  preprocessor. In particular, it presents the design
                  of OPL++, a C++ modeling layer for constraint
                  programming that combines the salient features of
                  both approaches. Of particular interest is the
                  one-to-one correspondence between high-level models
                  and OPL++ statements and the negligible overhead
                  induced by the extensions },

  month = {September},
  abstract = {Techniques for reasoning about extensional properties of
functional programs are well-understood, but methods for analysing  the
underlying intensional, or operational properties have been much neglected.
This thesis presents the  development of several calculi for time analysis
of functional programs.

We focus on two features, higher-order functions and lazy evaluation, which
contribute much to the expressive power and semantic elegance of
functional languages, but serve to make operational properties more
opaque.

Analysing higher-order functions is problematic because complexity is
dependent not only on the cost of computing, but also on the cost of {\em
applying}\ function-valued expressions.  Techniques for statically deriving
programs which compute time-cost in the presence of arbitrary higher-order
functions are developed. The key to this process is the introduction of
syntactic structures called {\em cost-closures}, which enable intensional
properties to be carried by functions. The approach is formalised by the
construction of an appropriate cost-model, against which the correctness of
the derivation is proved. A specific factorisation tactic for reasoning
about higher-order functions out of context is illustrated.

Reasoning about lazy evaluation (ie call-by-name, or more usually,
call-by-need) is problematic because the cost of evaluating an expression
cannot be understood simply from the costs of its sub-expressions.  A
direct calculus for reasoning about a call-by-name language with lazy lists
is derived from a simple operational model. In order to extend this
calculus with a restricted form of equational reasoning, a nonstandard
notion of operational approximation called {\em cost-simulation} is
developed, by analogy with {\em (bi)simulation} in CCS.

The problem with calculi of the above form, based directly on an
operational model, is that they do not yield a {\em compositional}
description of cost, and cannot model {\em lazy evaluation}
(graph-reduction) easily. We show how a description of the {\em context} in
which a function is evaluated can be used to parameterise two types of
time-equation: {\em sufficient-time} equations and {\em necessary-time}
equations, which together provide bounds on the exact time-cost of lazy
evaluation.  This approach is extended to higher-order functions using a
modification of the cost-closure technique.},

                  functional strict programming language which relies
                  heavily on run-time code generation. Closures are
                  not implemented as data structures containing code
                  pointers and bindings for free variables, but
                  instead by generating the machine code for a closure
                  each time it is constructed. The actual values of
                  free variables are embedded into the machine code
                  instead of using references to a closure record. The
                  goal of this experimental implementation is to
                  examine the possibilities of run-time code
                  generation -- and just-in-time compilation in
                  general -- in the context of purely functional
                  languages. The implementation details are described
                  and the performance of several example programs is
                  measured and compared to other functional language
                  implementations. }

                  a higher-order, functional language with ML-style
                  let-polymorphism. This specification supports the
                  general unCurrying of functions, even for functions
                  that are passed as arguments or returned as
                  values. The specification also supports partial
                  unCurrying of any consecutive parameters of a
                  function, rather than only unCurrying all of a
                  function's parameters. We present the specification
                  as a deductive system that axiomatizes a judgment
                  relating a source term with an unCurried form of the
                  term. We prove that this system relates only typable
                  terms and that it is correct with respect to an
                  operational semantics. We define a practical
                  algorithm, based on algorithm W, that implements
                  unCurrying and prove this algorithm sound and
                  complete with respect to the deductive system. This
                  algorithm generates maximally unCurried forms of
                  source terms. These results provide a declarative
                  framework for reasoning about unCurrying and support
                  a richer form of unCurrying than is currently found

  abstract =	 {Arity raising, also known as variable splitting or
                  flattening, is the program optimization which
                  transforms a function of one argument into a
                  function of several arguments by decomposing the
                  structure of the original one argument into
                  individual components in that structure. This
                  optimization eliminates the need for the structuring
                  of the components and also allows more arguments to
                  be passed in registers during a function call. We
                  present a formal specification of arity raising for
                  a higher-order functional language. This
                  specification supports the general arity raising of

  abstract =	 {This report summarizes operational approaches to the
                  formal semantics of programming languages and shows
                  that they can be interpreted inductively by least
                  fixed points as well as coinductively by greatest
                  fixed points. While the inductive interpretation
                  gives semantics to all terminating programs, the
                  coinductive one defines moreover also a semantics
                  for all non-terminating programs. This is especially
                  important in areas where programs do not terminate
                  in general, e.g. data bases, operating systems, or
                  control software in embedded systems. The semantic
                  foundations described in this report can be used to
                  verify that transformations (e.g. in compilers) of
                  such software systems are correct. In the course of
                  this report, coalgebras and coinduction are
                  introduced, starting with a gentle intuitive
                  motivation and ending with a detailed mathematical
                  description within the notions of category theory.},

                  on Microosft's extensible Visual Studio
                  environment. Visual Haskell provides a number of
                  features not found in existing Haskell development
                  environments: interactive error-checking, displaying
                  of inferred types in the editor, and other features
                  based on static properties of the source
                  code. Visual Haskell also provides full support for
                  developing and building multi-module Haskell
                  projects, based on the Cabal architecture. Visual
                  Haskell supports the full GHC language, and can be
                  used to develop real Haskell applications (including
                  the code of the plugin itself). Visual Haskell has
                  driven developments in other Haskell-related
                  projects: Cabal, the Concurrent FFI extension, and
                  an API to allow programmatic access to GHC
                  itself. Furthermore, development of the Visual
                  Haskell plugin required industrial-strength foreign
                  language interoperability; we describe all our
                  experiences in detail. },

                  Baker's incremental garbage collection algorithm
                  into the Spineless Tagless G-machine on stock
                  hardware. This algorithm eliminates the stop/go
                  execution associated with bulk copying collection
                  algorithms, allowing the system to place an upper
                  bound on the pauses due to garbage collection. The
                  technique exploits the fact that objects are always
                  accessed by jumping to code rather than being
                  explicitly dereferenced. It works by modifying the
                  entry code-pointer when an object is in the
                  transient state of being evacuated but not
                  scavenged. An attempt to enter it from the mutator
                  causes the object to "self-scavenge" transparently
                  before resetting its entry code pointer. We describe
                  an implementation of the scheme in v4.01 of the
                  Glasgow Haskell Compiler and report performance
                  results obtained by executing a range of
                  applications. These experiments show that the read
                  barrier can be implemented in dynamic dispatching
                  systems such as the STG-machine with very short
                  mutator pause times and with negligible overhead on
                  execution time. },

                  complex computer systems still fail, primarily due
                  to nondeterministic bugs that are typically resolved
                  by rebooting. Conceding that Heisenbugs will remain
                  a fact of life, we propose a systematic
                  investigation of restarts as "high availability
                  medicine." In this paper we show how recursive
                  restartability (RR) -- the ability of a system to
                  gracefully tolerate restarts at multiple levels --
                  improves fault tolerance, reduces time-to-repair,
                  and enables system designers to build flexible,
                  highly available software infrastructures. Using
                  several examples of widely deployed software
                  systems, we identify properties that are required of
                  RR systems and outline an agenda for turning the
                  recursive restartability philosophy into a practical
                  software structuring tool. Finally, we describe
                  infrastructural support for RR systems, along with
                  initial ideas on how to analyze and benchmark such
                  systems.}

                  dramatically increase performance in embedded

                  understand, their unusual functions and their
                  parallelism make it dicult for automatic code
                  generation algorithms to use them eectively. In this
                  paper, we present a new optimizing code generation
                  method that can deploy these operations successfully
                  while also verifying that the generated code is a
                  correct translation of the input program. },

  abstract =	 {The compilation of functional programming languages
                  such as Standard ML and Haskell rely on a number of
                  program transformations/optimizations in order to
                  generate efficient code. In this thesis, I present
                  formal, type-based specifications of three such
                  transformations: useless-variable elimination,
                  lambda-lifting and unCurrying. These three
                  transformations have in common the fact that they
                  all involve the analysis and manipulation of
                  function parameters. Useless-variable elimination
                  identifies function parameters whose corresponding
                  arguments contribute nothing to the observable
                  behavior of the program, and eliminates those
                  arguments. Lambda-lifting introduces additional
                  parameters to functions in order to eliminate
                  occurrences of non-local, non-global
                  variables. UnCurrying transforms Curried functions
                  and applications so that functions are applied to
                  multiple arguments in a single application. The
                  conciseness and simplicity of type-based analyses
                  provide a convenient platform for reasoning about
                  program transformation. Using straightforward
                  induction techniques, we can prove properties such
                  as type preservation and operational correctness. We
                  can guarantee the correctness of specific algorithms
                  by proving via induction that these algorithms are
                  sound with respect to the formal specification. I
                  present a number of these proofs in this thesis.},

                  exceptions belonging to any subclass in the

                  \textsf{vmgen}-based interpreter, and gives some

                  implement a new functional language for parallel
                  programming. Unlike many earlier parallel languages,
                  Manticore is a \emph{heterogeneous} language that
                  supports parallelism at multiple
                  levels. Specifically, we combine CML-style explicit
                  concurrency with fine-grain, implicitly threaded,
                  parallel constructs. We have been working on an

  abstract =     "Writing performance-critical programs can be
                  frustrating because optimizing compilers for
                  imperative languages tend to be unpredictable. For a
                  subset of optimizations - those that simplify rather
                  than reorder code - it would be useful to prove that
                  a compiler reliably performs optimizations. We show
                  that adopting a ``superanalysis'' approach to
                  optimization enables such a proof. By analogy with
                  linear algebra, we define the nullspace of an
                  optimizer as those programs it reduces to the empty
                  program. To span the nullspace, we define rewrite
                  rules that de-optimize programs by introducing
                  abstraction. For a model compiler we prove that any
                  sequence of de-optimizing rewrite rule applications
                  is undone by the optimizer. Thus, we are able to
                  give programmers a clear mental model of what
                  simplifications the compiler is guaranteed to
                  perform, and make progress on the problem of
                  ``abstraction penalty'' in imperative languages."
